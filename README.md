# Code Wars Training

In this repository, you will find exercises and their solutions from [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com).

The main purpose is to share my solutions as I practice various programming languages and programming logic.

**Note:** I'm not an expert in programming, so probably many of the solutions may not be optimal.

## Languages Used

I primarily focus on practicing JavaScript, which is why most of the exercises and solutions are in that language. However, I will also try to include solutions in other programming languages such as:

- JavaScript
- Java
- C#

Feel free to explore and learn from these solutions with me!
